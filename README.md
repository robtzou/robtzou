# Hello, I'm Robert
## Nice to meet you!👋

My current goal is to build the skills necessary to create **full scale web** and **mobile applications**.

I find that AI as a tool to be one that will take decades to be properly integrated,
that being said, most if not all of my projects will be utilizing AI, ML, or OD in some way.
  
Languages: **Python 🐍 & Typescript ⌨️**
